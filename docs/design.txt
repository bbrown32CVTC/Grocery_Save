“Grocery Save” - Design

Problem Statement:

There is a need to build an interactive text game where the user’s character has three bags of groceries to carry home. It will need to alert the user 
with the storyline when the game starts. The user is then prompted three different times the direction they want to go (left, right, or straight) in 
the storyline, which will determine if the user’s character will drop either of the three bags. Display to the user of the outcome of that choice. 
The game is over as soon as the user’s character reaches the end of the story. It will display an output at the end of the game to show how many 
grocery bags remain and which of the four rewards is earned. Three bags remaining will result in a gold survival reward, two bags remaining results 
a silver survival reward, one bag remaining results in a copper survival reward, and no bags remaining will result in the starvation reward. The game
 will start over if the user does not say “no” when asked to play again.

Nouns: three bags of groceries, direction, output, four rewards, play again
Verbs: prompted, drop, alert, display, remaining, start over
